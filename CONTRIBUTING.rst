Introduction
============

Zoom Autojoiner (ZAJ) is a huge project, more than 900 lines of code. It is at
an early stage and is growing pretty fast. However, when the project becomes big, 
new people should be able to understand the code. Keeping this in mind, it is
imperative on your part to follow the below guidelines.

Guidelines
==========
+ All code must adhere to **PEP 8**. 
+ When writing docstrings, follow **Google Style.**
    + Please be succinct when writing the docstring
+ Add PEP 484 type hints.
+ Try to use the new Extensions API to the maximum extent.
+ Do write code that
    + fixes issues
    + implements features that fall into the `goals`_ of this project
